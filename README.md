- Four main query input fields:
  - All these words
  - Exact word or phrase
  - Any of these words
  - None of these words
- Informational tips on how to use advanced Google search operators
- "Go Back to Google search" navigation link
- Styled submit button for form submission

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the HTML and CSS files.
2. Open the `index.html` (or whatever the main file is named) in any modern web browser.
3. Type in search terms using the fields.
4. Click "Advanced search" to submit the form.

## Folder Structure
